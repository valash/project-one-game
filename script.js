// what i need to have 
// need to have an array with 5 questions and 5 answers
// need to have same 5 questions with wrong answers
// question 1 = correct answer wrong answer 
let question1 = [
    correct1 = "",
    wrong1 = ""
]
// question 2 = correct answer wrong answer 
let question2 = [

// what needs to happen 
// page loads 
// has one question and 2 potential answers 
let playerScore = document.querySelector('.Score');
let currentScore = 000;

const gameSetup = function(evt) {
    //puts question in the question box
    //puts two answers in the option boxes
}



// one option is correct 
// when click on the correct answer turn the box green alert that you are correct 
// score goes up 100 points 
// loads next question
